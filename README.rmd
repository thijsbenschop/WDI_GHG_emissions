## Suggestions for GHG indicators

Choice of indicators depends on different factors:

* Data availability (country coverage/time series)
* Methodology used
* Reliability of data
* Relevance to development

Possible indicators:

* Emissions by type in CO2e (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases (SF6) + total)
* Emissions by sector/categories â€“ use IPCC 1996 categories
* Change from base year 1990
* Per capita emissions (only total?)
* Carbon intensity of economy (CO2e / GDP)
* Concentration in atmosphere
