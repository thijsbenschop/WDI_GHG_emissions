Talking points for meeting with Stephane Hallegatte on Thursday, May 19, 2022

Objective of meeting: present proposal for reviewing GHG indicators in WDI and receive feedback, especially w.r.t. CCDR GHG indicators

1) Present current indicators in WDI and shortcomings:
- combination of CAIT data since 1990 + CDIAC data before 1960 for GHG emissions
- other indicators from various sources
- overview of indicators by sector/GHG
- issues with consistency and comparability across time and indicators
- low country coverage and time coverage for some indicators (show plot)
- present scoring for current indicators (?)
- issue with license and availability for IEA data

2) Potential data sources
- briefly go over different options and characteristics plus shortcomings
- including PIK, CAIT, official SDG indicators
- present why propose to use PIK, advantages over CAIT (time coverage, completeness) 

3) Present PIK data
- country coverage, time coverage
- third-party series, country-reported series
- sector disaggregation
- GHG gases
- update frequency

4) Indicator selection
- Combination of GHG and sectors
- Does the indicator selection serve broad users as a core set of the GHG emission series?
- Is this set useful for CCDR - need for additional sector disaggregation?
- Additional indicators:
                - per capita GHG emissions
                - carbon intensity (CO2/GDP)
                - % changes
                - change from base year 1990

5) Questions
- LUCF inclusion
- third-party vs. country-reported
- use of extrapolated values
