### Data uncertainty

According to the Working Group III Contribution to the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report, global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are
known within *8%* uncertainty (90% confidence interval). CO2 emissions
from FOLU (forestry and other land use) have very large uncertainties
associated with them in the order of *± 50%*. Uncertainty for global
emissions of CH4, N2O and the F-gases has been estimated as *20%*, *60%*
and *20%* respectively. For the PIK dataset, regional deforestation
emissions are downscaled to the country level using estimates of the
deforested area obtained from potential vegetation and calculations for
the needed agricultural land. Accordingly levels of uncertainty are
quite high for earlier years of data (closer to 1850).

This would be an argument to exclude LULUCF.

How are values for the Russian Federation before 1992 computed? As share
of USSR? CDIAC lists Russia only starting 1992.

### Understanding differences

  - Different methodologies
  - Different categories
  - Different geographical boundaries
  - Underlying data in most cases the same (CDIAC before, )

## Suggestions for GHG indicators

Choice of indicators depends on different factors:

  - Data availability (country coverage/time series)
  - Methodology used
  - Reliability of data
  - Relevance to development

List of indicators: \* Emissions by type in CO2e (CO2, methane, nitrous
oxide, fluorinated gases (SF6) + total) \* Emissions by
sector/categories – use IPCC 1996 categories \* Change from base year
1990 (own computation) \* Per capita emissions (only total?) (own
computation) \* Carbon intensity of economy (CO2e / GDP) (own
computation)

  - Concentration in atmosphere
  - Pathways ?

Miscellaneous

  - Add more detail to description of series (e.g., )
  - Difference CAIT and PIK: CAIT doesn’t use official inventories
    reported UNFCCC, PIK does for countries where available

## Questions

  - Factors used for computation of CO2e of other GHGs -\> different
    factors used
  - Use extrapolated values for subset of countries for the years
    2016-2018
