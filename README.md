GHG emissions sources and indicators
================

## Indicators included in WDI

Currently, the following GHG emissions indicators are included in the
WDI:

## Suggestions for GHG indicators

Choice of indicators depends on different factors:

  - Data availability (country coverage/time series)
  - Methodology used
  - Reliability of data
  - Relevance to development

Possible indicators:

  - Emissions by type in CO2e (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated
    gases (SF6) + total)
  - Emissions by sector/categories – use IPCC 1996 categories
  - Change from base year 1990
  - Per capita emissions (only total?)
  - Carbon intensity of economy (CO2e / GDP)
  - Concentration in atmosphere
  - Pathways ?

### Category codes

Category descriptions using IPCC 1996 terminology.

| Code   | Description                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0      | National Total                                   |
| M.0.EL | National Total, excluding LULUCF                 |
| 1      | Total Energy                                     |
| 1.A    | Fuel Combustion Activities                       |
| 1.B    | Fugitive Emissions from Fuels                    |
| 2      | Industrial Processes                             |
| 3      | Solvent and Other Product Use                    |
| 4      | Agriculture                                      |
| 5      | Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) |
| 6      | Waste                                            |
| 7      | Other                                            |

## Data sources

  - CDIAC - Carbon Dioxide Information analysis Center :
    <https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/meth_reg.html>, data
    from 1751 until 2014
  - CAIT/Climate Watch - World Resources Institute:
    <https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2018&start_year=1990>
  - PIK - Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research:

  - GCP - Global Carbon Project:
  - IEA - International Energy Agency -

### Data uncertainty

According to the Working Group III Contribution to the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report, global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are
known within 8% uncertainty (90% confidence interval). CO2 emissions
from FOLU (forestry and other land use) have very large uncertainties
associated with them in the order of ± 50%. Uncertainty for global
emissions of CH4, N2O and the F-gases has been estimated as 20%, 60% and
20% respectively. For the PIK dataset, regional deforestation emissions
are downscaled to the country level using estimates of the deforested
area obtained from potential vegetation and calculations for the needed
agricultural land. Accordingly levels of uncertainty are quite high for
earlier years of data (closer to 1850).

This would be an argument to exclude
